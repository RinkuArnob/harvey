      <h1>Harvey: A Second Face for Your JavaScript</h1>

      <p>
        Harvey executes certain parts of your JavaScript depending on the current deviceâ€™s type, screen size, resolution, orientation, or any other of the same media query conditions you can use in CSS.
      </p>
    </header>


    <h2>Responsive JavaScript&mdash;finally</h2>

    <p>
      Responsive and mobile first web design is inarguably a great way to build futureproof websites and applications.
      But the one thing CSS media queries can&rsquo;t always help us with is improving the way users interact with our interfaces.
      Harvey helps you adjusting your JavaScript to optimize the user&rsquo;s experience for their output device whenever necessary.

      <dt>Small footprint</dt>
      <dd>The script weighs only 1k gzipped and has no external dependencies. Also it is originally written in CoffeeScript.</dd>

      <dt>&hellip;As easy as flipping a coin</dt>
      <dd>Harvey has a straight-forward public API with just two static methods that still allow for unlimited customization.</dd>

      <dt>Broad browser support</dt>
      <dd>Polyfills and browser fixes are automatically applied wherever necessary so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about them.</dd>
    </dl>


    <h2>What does Harvey look like?</h2>

    <p>
      The only two methods you need to completely control Harvey are <code>Harvey.attach()</code> and <code>Harvey.detach()</code>.
      When attaching a condition to Harvey (in the form of a valid CSS media query), you can also register up to three callbacks for it:
    </p>

    <code>
      Harvey.attach( 'screen and (min-width: 40em)', {
        setup: function() {},
        on: function() {},
        off: function() {}
      });
    </code>

    <small class="tip">You can repeat this step multiple times and for any valid media query you need.</small>

    <h3>When to use callbacks</h3>

    <dl class="callbacks">
      <dt><code>setup</code></dt>
      <dd>
        Called the first time the media query becomes valid.
        <small class="tip">Tip: Use the setup callback to load extra assets or manipulate the DOM.</small>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>on</code></dt>
      <dd>
        Called every time the media query becomes valid.
        <small class="tip">Tip: Use the on callback to reveal changes you made (e.g. in setup).</small>
      </dd>

      <dt><code>off</code></dt>
      <dd>
        Called every time the media query becomes invalid.
        <small class="tip">Tip: Use the off callback to revert/hide changes you made (e.g. in setup).</small>
      </dd>
    </dl>
