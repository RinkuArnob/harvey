# Harvey

Harvey lets you add a second face to your application's JavaScript. It has no dependencies and comes in at about 3k minified or 1k gzipped. Neat!

For documentation, usage, and examples, see:

### Browser Support

Thanks to its various fallbacks and polyfills Harvey works across all modern browsers (IE > 8) that support [CSS media queries](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-mediaqueries).

### Resources

* Harvey was inspired by Nicholas C. Zakas' article on the different problems with matchMedia
  http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/01/19/css-media-queries-in-javascript-part-2/

* Harvey uses a variation of Paul Irish's matchMedia.js polyfill
